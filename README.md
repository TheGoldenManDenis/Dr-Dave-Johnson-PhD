Puzzle game written in BBC Basic, for the Brandy interpreter

It's a falling blocks puzzle game where the aim is to fill a certain percentage of the screen with blocks, while losing as few blocks as possible.
There are four different kinds of block, and if you have four or more of the same kind connecting, they react and disappear, and the score increases. The aim is to finish with as little score as possible.
